// What is Changed in this version (1.5.0)
//
// New-Features:
// Capcha system using temporary inventory and selecting a Minecraft-Block on joining a server.
// Passwords can now be used by selecting a Minecraft-Block when Registering, Player Login and Change password,
// 		instead of typing in a password on then Register, Login and ChangePass commands by showing a temporary inventory. 
// 		AmkMcAuth uses the placeholder 'menu' where you normaly would type the password itself.
// 		If AmkMcAuth sees the "password": 'menu' it opens a temporary inventory with random blocks and the 
//		player has to click the block the he has set/uses as his password-block.
//
// Bug-Fix:
// Optimized(instantly) MySQL update when changing password, thanks to bukkit-member mdfm28 who made the changes to the code.  
//
// ToDo:
// adding "type password twice" option on register, just to be sure, so the player checks his own password.
// adding security question to reset own password if answer on security question is correct.
//
// adding bStats Server build (Spigot Paper eg.)
//
// IcedToDo:
// "clear player inventory on Join when not logged in and restore on Login and/or leave"
// This can now be done using inventory plugins by setting the OnJoin, OnLogin and OnLeave AmkMcAuth events
// adding option to prevent player "pushing" when "teleport_to_spawn: true: is used. But Hiding not logged-in Players works!
